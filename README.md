# ClimateCollab2.0
My redoing of the climate collab project. Which was my first solo hackathon project.

# What I am changing
- The tech stack is getting overhauled
- Using Next Js, prisma but keeping the general idea of a React mongoDB application 
- Can now write backend code in my application an external api is now optional 

# What I have learned 
- Proper user authentication is something I am including in this application
- How to seperate logic and code into files to be added in to the main app

# Challenges 
- The algorithm that is used to calculate the emissions needs to be better than the hacakthon version 
- I need to be able to adjust for the average. and handle lack of inputs just as before
- I need to find a way to better handle data over time
- This my largest project especially on the frontend and it requires handeling a lot of data and making it appear properly

# As and If I scale
- Naturally I make the move to production a serveless mongoDB db will be used as opposed to the free tier
- If I scale as of now I am considering bringing in an external api right now in cpp. To caclulate the total carbon emissions
- This level of scaling is a big if and I will be estatic if I get to that point!!
- I may transistion to typescript in the future. An app with a lot of json, objects and data being sent back and forth would benefit from type checks
