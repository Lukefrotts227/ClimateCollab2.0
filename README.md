# ClimateCollab2.0
My redoing of the climate collab project. Which was my first solo hackathon project.

# What I am changing
- The tech stack is getting overhauled
- Using Next Js, prisma but keeping the general idea of a React mongoDB application 
- Can now write backend code in my application an external api is now optional 

# What I have learned 
- Proper user authentication is something I am including in this application
- How to seperate logic and code into files to be added in to the main app

# Challenges 
- The algorithm that is used to calculate the emissions needs to be better than the hacakthon version 
- I need to be able to adjust for the average. and handle lack of inputs just as before
- I need to find a way to better handle data over time
